# Rules

Each rule is documented with 5 pieces of information:
- Hint: A brief instruction on how to modify failing SystemVerilog.
  Also displayed in supported editors using [svls](https://github.com/dalance/svls).
- Reason: A one sentence explanation of the rule's purpose.
  Also displayed in supported editors using [svls](https://github.com/dalance/svls).
- Pass Example: A valid piece of SystemVerilog which is known to pass the rule.
  Ideally, this will show an example of best-practice.
- Fail Example: A valid piece of SystemVerilog which is known to fail the rule.
  In some cases the code shows multiple commented examples.
- Explanation: A full explanation of the rule's purpose with references to any
  other relevant information sources.

In each rule's explanation there is a "see also" list of other rules, each with
a short reason why it should be seen.
- "suggested companion" - Suggestions are given for rules which do not check
  semantics, i.e suggestions are for style and naming conventions only.
- "potential companion" - These are noted where the named rule is given
  primarily out of completeness, but their use may cause other issues.
  For example, **style_keyword_datatype** exists to ensure all SystemVerilog
  keywords are captured in the `style_keyword_*` set, but its use is not
  suggested because it is visually appealing (and common practice) to align
  the identifiers in declarations.
- "useful companion" - Enabling the named rule provides an additional set of
  properties which are useful for reasoning about the function and semantics of
  code which passes.
  For example, the conjunction of **localparam_type_twostate** and
  **localparam_explicit_type** allows for stronger confidence that the author
  has properly considered the type of each constant.
- "alternative" - The named rule *should* not be used in conjunction, i.e.
  enabling both rules is, at best, a waste compute power.
- "mutually exclusive alternative" - The named rule *can* not be used in
  conjunction, i.e. enabling both rules is nonsensical because a failure on one
  implies a pass on the other rule.
