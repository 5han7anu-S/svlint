## Installation

### Download binary

Download from [release page](https://github.com/dalance/svlint/releases/latest), and extract to the directory in PATH.

### snapcraft

You can install from [snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/svlint)

```
sudo snap install svlint
```

### Cargo

You can install by [cargo](https://crates.io/crates/svlint).

```
cargo install svlint
```

## Usage

### Configuration

First of all, you must put a configuration file `.svlint.toml` to specify enabled rules.
Configuration file is searched to the upper directory until `/`.
So you can put configuration file (`.svlint.toml`) on the repository root
alongside `.gitignore`.
Alternatively, for project-wide rules you can set the environment variable
`SVLINT_CONFIG` to something like `/cad/projectFoo/teamBar.svlint.toml`.

The example of configuration file is below:

```toml
[option]
exclude_paths = ["ip/.*"]
prefix_label = ""

[rules]
non_ansi_module = true
keyword_forbidden_wire_reg = true
```

The complete example can be generated by `svlint --example`

#### `[option]` section

- `exclude_paths` is a list of regular expressions.
  If a file path is matched with the list, the file is skipped to check.
- `prefix_(inout|input|output)` are strings which port identifiers must begin
  with.
  Only used when the corresponding rule is enabled.
  Defaults to `"b_"`, `"i_"`, and `"o_"` respectively.
- `prefix_label` is a string which generate labels must begin with.
  Applicable to `if/else`, `for`, and `case` generate constructs when the
  corresponding `generate_*_with_label` rule is enabled.
  Defaults to `"l_"`.
  To check only that a label exists, set this to `""`.
- `prefix_instance` is a string which instances must begin with.
  Defaults to `"u_"`.
- `prefix_(interface|module|package)` are strings which definitions must begin
  with.
  An alternative naming convention for interface, module, and package names is
  uppercase/lowercase first letter.
  This is similar to Haskell where types begin with uppercase and variables
  begin with lowercase.
  These alternative rules are called
  `(lower|upper)camelcase_(interface|module|package)`.
- `re_(forbidden|required)_*` are regular expressions for detailed naming
  conventions, used only when the corresponding rules are enabled.
  The defaults for `re_required_*` are either uppercase, lowercase, or
  mixed-case starting with lowercase, i.e. just vaguely sensible.
  The defaults for `re_forbidden_*` are to forbid all strings, except those
  starting with "X", i.e. not at all sensible (configuration required).

#### `[rules]` section

By default, all rules are disabled.
To enable a rule, assign `true` to its name, e.g. `case_default = true`.

#### Configuration update

If svlint is updated, `.svlint.toml` can be updated to the latest version with
`svlint --update`.

### Rules

All rules are documented [here](./RULES.md).
You are welcome to suggest a new rule through
[Issues](https://github.com/dalance/svlint/issues) or
[Pull Requests](https://github.com/dalance/svlint/pulls).
Some example rulesets, are available [here](https://github.com/DaveMcEwan/svlint-rulesets).

If you need to turn off specific rules for a section, then you can use special comments:
```systemverilog
/* svlint off keyword_forbidden_always */
always @* foo = bar;                      // <-- This line is special.
/* svlint on keyword_forbidden_always */
```

### Plugin rules

svlint supports plugin rules, an example of which is available
[here](https://github.com/dalance/svlint-plugin-sample).

### Filelist

svlint supports filelist like major EDA tools.
The following features are supported.

* Substitute environment variables
* Specify include directories by `+incdir`
* Define Verilog define by `+define`
* Include other filelists by `-f`

An example is below:

```
xxx.sv
${XXX_DIR}/yyy.sv
$(XXX_DIR)/zzz.sv
+incdir+$PWD/header/src
+define+SYNTHESIS
-f other.f
```
